# QTM 151 - Introduction to Statistical Computing II

## Quiz 04 - SQL

In this quiz, you will demonstrate your ability to write SQL queries and extract information from tables.

### Instructions

- You are free to use any resources available to you, including the internet, but you are not allowed to discuss the quiz with anyone else.
- You are also free to use any database management system you prefer (pgAdmin, SQLAlchemy, SQLite, etc.), but the queries must be written in SQL.
- Please submit your answers as a `.sql`, `.ipynb`, or `.html` file. If you submit an `.html` file, please include the SQL queries.

### Data

You will work with two tables, one named `cars` and the other named `brand_data`. They are both available as `.csv` files in this repository, or you can create them yourself using the data provided in the `.sql` file or the Jupyter Notebook. The tables have the following columns:
